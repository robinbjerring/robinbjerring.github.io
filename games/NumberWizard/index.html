        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          A master of IT looking for work as a game designer, project manager or user researcher.

      <p>
        Design in IT is my favorite thing. I recently completed the DADIU course as a lead game designer
        (The National Academy of Digital, Interactive Entertainment). During my master of IT I wrote projects on esports economy, AI in games and lootboxes.
        My master thesis is about the percieved difficulty of video games. While games is of course a big part of my life, I also enjoyed
        doing lectures on cryptocurrency and blockchain for fellow students as well as through a blockchain network, I started.
        In 2018 I lead game design on the iOS and Android DADIU game Night Painter and at Nordic Game Jam 2016 my co-designers and me won an award for best board game.
        When I am not making games or talking about cryptocurrency, I write music and edit music. And then I read Batman comics.
